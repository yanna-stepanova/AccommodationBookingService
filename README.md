<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">AccommodationBookingService</h1>
<p>This project is an online accommodation booking system. Users can browse and book different types of accommodations such as apartments, guest houses, and more. The system is built using the Spring Boot framework and follows the MVC architecture. The backend is supported by a PostgreSQL database and uses Liquibase for schema management. All operations are accessible via RESTful API with integrated Swagger documentation, providing a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>Components of the application:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Model</i>: Represents the data and business logic. In this project, it includes entities like User, Accommodation, Booking, and Payment.</li>
  <li><i>View</i>: This component is responsible for displaying data in a user-friendly format. It could be part of the frontend, but in the case it's APIs returning data in JSON format.</li>
  <li><i>Controller</i>: Handles user input and interaction with the model, typically through RESTful API requests. In Spring MVC, this layer mediates between the frontend and backend.</li>
</ol>

<p>The UML diagram provides a visual representation of the relationships between the entities (models) in the system. It shows how entities like User, Accommodation, Booking, and Payment are related to each other and how they interact in the system. This helps in understanding the overall structure and flow of the system.</p>

<p>Key entities (models) in this application:</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>User</u>: Stores information about the registered user, including their authentication details.</li>
    <li><u>Role</u>: Represents the roles assigned to users for managing their access and permissions within the system. Each role is uniquely identified by its name (e.g., ADMIN, CUSTOMER).</li>
    <li><u>RoleName</u>: An enumeration defining the possible roles in the system. Each role (e.g., ADMIN, CUSTOMER) is associated with a string representation and can be retrieved programmatically.</li>
    <li><u>Status</u>: An enumeration representing the status of bookings and payments. Possible statuses include `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, `CANCELED`, `EXPIRED`, and `PAID`.</li>
    <li><u>Type</u>: An enumeration defining the types of accommodations available in the system. Examples include `APARTMENT`, `HOTEL`, `VILLA`, and `VACATION_HOME`.</li>
    <li><u>Amenity</u>: Represents the features or facilities available in an accommodation, such as Wi-Fi, parking, or a swimming pool. Amenities are associated with accommodations to help users filter and select properties based on their preferences.</li>
    <li><u>Location</u>: Represents the geographical location of an accommodation, including details such as the address, city, state, and country. The Location entity is essential for search and filtering operations based on user-specified areas.</li>
    <li><u>Accommodation</u>: Represents available properties such as apartments or houses.</li>
    <li><u>Booking</u>: Represents a booking made by a user for accommodation.</li>
    <li><u>Payment</u>: Handles the payment details for a booking.</li>
